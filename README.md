## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project focuses on automation testing for the OrangeHRM demo website using **Selenium WebDriver** with the **Page Object Model (POM)** and **Cucumber** for Behavior-Driven Development (BDD). The primary objective is to verify core functionalities such as login, user management, leave management, attendance tracking, and reporting. The framework is designed for modularity, reusability, and scalability, ensuring robust and maintainable test coverage.
